**A vision for making AI text detection as accessible as AI text generation.**

This is a fork of the original [Binoculars](https://github.com/ahans30/Binoculars) project, with the goal of creating an accessible AI text detection tool for everyday users. This project is currently **under active development** and exploring different approaches to achieve this vision.

## The Vision

As AI text generation becomes increasingly accessible, the ability to detect AI-generated content should be equally accessible. This project aims to combat the negative impacts that undetected AI-generated text can have on society and academia by eventually providing everyone with a free, easy-to-use detection tool.

**Long-term Goal**: Create a web application that allows anyone to detect AI-generated text without technical knowledge, expensive hardware, or payment barriers.

## Current Status

ðŸš§ **This project is in early development** ðŸš§

We're exploring several approaches:
- **Web Application**: Hosted service that runs detection on cloud infrastructure
- **User Experience**: Simple, intuitive interface requiring no technical knowledge
- **Accessibility**: Free access model (funding/sustainability model still being determined)
- **Performance**: Optimizing models to run efficiently on limited server resources

## What We're Working Toward

- **Zero-barrier access**: No downloads, installations, or technical setup
- **Instant results**: Paste text, get immediate detection results
- **Free to use**: No subscriptions, API fees, or usage limits (pending funding solutions)
- **Privacy-focused**: Minimal data retention and secure processing
- **Broad accessibility**: Usable by students, educators, journalists, researchers, and curious individuals

## Current Challenges

- **Hosting costs**: Running AI models requires computational resources
- **Funding model**: Exploring sustainable ways to offer free service
- **Technical optimization**: Balancing accuracy with computational efficiency
- **User experience design**: Making detection results clear and actionable
- **Scaling**: Handling potentially high user demand

## How to Help

This project needs contributors who share the vision of democratizing AI detection:

- **Developers**: Help optimize models for efficiency and build web infrastructure
- **UX/UI Designers**: Design intuitive interfaces for non-technical users
- **Researchers**: Improve detection accuracy and reduce computational requirements
- **Community**: Spread awareness and provide feedback on the vision
- **Funding/Business**: Help solve the sustainability challenge

## Current State

The code in this repository is based on the original Binoculars research but is being modified and optimized. Right now, it can be run locally by technical users, but this is not the end goal.

## Vision vs. Reality

**What we envision**: A simple website where anyone can paste text and instantly know if it's AI-generated.

**Where we are now**: A research codebase that requires technical knowledge to use.

**The gap**: We're working to bridge this gap through web development, infrastructure planning, and community building.

## Stay Updated

This project is evolving rapidly. Check back for updates as we work toward making AI text detection truly accessible to everyone.
